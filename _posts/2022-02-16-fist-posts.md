That's the first post of a blog I hope I'll have enough self-discipline to slowly transform into a repository of all sorts of knowledge. Let me start by presenting myself: I'm Jordi Marias I Parella a, what in Spain is called, a Telecommunications Engineer (with a major in Networks), in other parts of the world would be called a mix between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I'm from Barcelona, and as usual in this city, I speak three languages close to the native level: Catalan(my mother tongue), Spanish and English. And I work as a mobility researcher within I2CAT, generally developing, assessing and pushing forward V2X (vehicle-to-everything) technologies.

The motivation behind starting this blog, and I know that probably nobody will ever read this first personal and somehow non-interesting post, comes from reading the book "Soft-Skills: Software Developer's Life Manual" which is a book that I'll review soon. Especially from the part that remarks the importance of marketeer yourself to be able to get more opportunities.

The purpose of this blog is mainly to create a repository of knowledge regarding all of the challenges I found while working as a Researcher and Developer. Along with some book summaries/reviews that I'm reading on my free time to compliment all of my education.
